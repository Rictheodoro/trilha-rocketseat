# 👨‍🚀 Rocketseat's Explorer coursework projects

<br>

This is the way I've found to document my journey as a rookie Web Developer 🚀

Here you'll find coursework projects and study exercises I'm gathering throughout my experience on the Explorer course at Rocketseat, as well as other little projects I do along the way.   

Check out **[📙 my learning journal](https://bpires.github.io/rocketseat-explorer/docs/#/)** on this repo docs.

If you like this way of documenting your journey, feel free to reach out and ask me anything. It will be my pleasure to help you out! 

Also, I'd really appreciate it if you say thanks **by ⭐ starring this repo**.

> ℹ️ **Did you know?**
> 
> The starring feature was introduced on GitHub in 2012. 
> Stars were a new way to keep track of repositories that you found interesting and caught your attention.
> So, in GitHub social etiquette, starring a repo is a way to bookmark a project as well as to express **how much you enjoy and find it interesting!**
